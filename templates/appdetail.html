    <p> Upon first opening the app, a window will appear asking users to continue as a service recipient, or service provider for the session/time they are logged in. As a recipient, your service requests will be automatically formatted and posted after you enter the necessary information, to ensure all requests are generated in the same manner and with the same details. You will include contact information for yourself, a descrition and applicable photo of the job/service, a general location (don't use your address for a public post), desired price range, and desired timeframe. Service Providers will be able to scroll through the posts and filter them by the details (pricing, location, recipient rating, etc.). Once a service provider has found your request to be a fit for them, they will contact you via the information you provided to individually confirm pricing, timeframe, and other necessary details. All service recipients will be rated; just as you will have the ability to rate your providers. Utilize our community of amazing service providers to take back some of the time you've been missing, and solve those problems that have been weighing on you for days. </p>

    <p> All service providers will function as complete individuals on the SPC application. You get paid for the work you do, and aren't losing any profits to pay for work that's not your own. It is for this reason that our system of community interaction is able to expand so rapidly, and benefit all of its members rather than a select few. When you sign into the app as a provider, you will see the available service requests within your given radius (15, 30, or 50 miles), and scroll through them like an ad or social media feed. Once you've found a request that interests you, simply click on it to open up a larger window with more details related to the job. Then, use the contact information provided on that window to reach out to the recipient. All pricing, scheduling, and payment will take place individually off of the app. Our platform is designed to provide connections and introductions, it will not be used to facilitate the entire transaction. Join the SPC application as a service provider to gain additional income opportunities, transition into entreprenuership, or even just have the freedom to work jobs of your choice with the hours you choose! </p>
